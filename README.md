# Can Guden Portfolio
Portolio Website (milestone project 1) (Code Institute 2021)

-General:
I making a portfolio website based on the Apple.com website using inspiration from them to keep a nice simple view. Using target"_blank for everylink to keep the website open except for the header links.

-Header:
Bootstrap header with Name on the left and links on the right.
Header: Mobile: Burgermenu, with the links. (taken from codepen) with javascript.
find the burgermenu on codepen, when viewed on mobile i wanted a full height down white and not scrollable. i solved it by playing with the @media and the webkit unscrollable in css. had a problem that when i used the vertical-y it didnt scroll at all anymore, i put in the @media and now its fine.


About - Projects - Work - Download CV (button)
i thought it looked to big and when i zoomed out on the browser it looked better, so i tried like zoom: 97% and it worked, but in mobile it changed too but through @media i set it to 100%.

-Section 1:
Quick preview of what the site is about and what i do.

-Section 2:
Projects showcase, when clicked on new page with the whole project. using next and previous projects with arrows. somehow the color of the previous arrow shows in black while the next arrow shows the link blue color, cant fix it. bootstrap maybe causing this.

-Contact: Lets work together with a button to te #contact page where there is a form.
having problems with the lenght of the input box, fixed that on desktop but mobile view looks bad. going to try with @media.

-Footer: Simple footer Email - Social links - Back to top button
when viewed on mobile they were stacking up automatically, i didnt want that, i fixed in css.
